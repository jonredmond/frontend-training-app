# Front End Training App

An sample application for the Backend to Frontend Javascript developer course homework.

## Problem Statement

Build a ReactJS application that connects to a backend service, demonstrating all the skills you have learnt in the course.
Inclusing: styling, component design, redux, asynchronous calls to an API.

Some examples/starting points:
* Todo list Application
* Budget tracker
* Blog application

If you don't want to build your own backend service, you can either use a service like [json placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) or use the backend service provided for this application which is available [here](https://github.com/archfirst/trader-desktop).

## This Application

This application is an example built using the [trader-desktop](https://github.com/archfirst/trader-desktop) problem statement. This was a test for learning key web technologies, the scenario being you have been asked to build a trader desktop application. The user should be able to create orders and then update a table/graph view as orders are placed/executed.
The repository linked has some sample designs that can be followed, or you can design your own UX if you're feeling creative. The important thing is to demonstrate that you are able to use all the technologies and patterns you have learn during the course.

### Running the App

To run the app, first make sure the backend service is running, you'll need to clone it and run it seperately.

Then make sure your node modules are up to date
```
npm install
```
and start the app by running
```
npm run start
```
