# Front End Training App

An sample application for the Backend to Frontend Javascript developer course homework.

## Problem Statement

Build a ReactJS application that connects to a backend service, demonstrating all the skills you have learnt in the course.
Inclusing: styling, component design, redux, asynchronous calls to an API.

Some examples/starting points:
* Todo list Application
* Budget tracker
* Blog application

If you don't want to build your own backend service, you can either use a service like [json placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) or use the backend service provided for this application which is available [here](https://github.com/archfirst/trader-desktop).

I encourage you to be as creative as possible and come up with your own ideas, but if you're really struggling you can use this app as an example.

## This Application

This application is an example built using the [trader-desktop](https://github.com/archfirst/trader-desktop) problem statement. This was a test for learning key web technologies, admittedly these are now a few years out of date, but we can use this as a starting point for our application which will be built using the modern technologies you've learnt about. 

The scenario for this application is, you have been asked to build a trader desktop application, the user should be able to create orders and then update a table/graph view as orders are placed/executed.

The repository linked has some sample designs that can be followed, or you can design your own UX if you're feeling particularly creative. The important thing is to demonstrate that you have understoop all the technologies and patterns you have learnt during the course.

### Running the App

To run the app, first make sure the backend service is running, you'll need to clone it and run it seperately.

Then make sure your node modules are up to date
```
npm install
```
and start the app by running
```
npm run start
```
